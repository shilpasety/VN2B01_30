'''Write a Python function to check whether a number is perfect or not.
According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of
its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself
(also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all
of its positive divisors (including itself).
Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors,
 and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive
 divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14.
 This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128.'''
