oops:

class: group of objects   data- logical, methods -physical
object:                   data - physical,  method - logical

encapusulation:combining data and methods to a single entity  eg .classname 

inheritence: one class property to another class

abstraction: hidden internal functionality shows behavior


polymorphism: many forms



access specifiers:public(own, derived, other), protected(own class, derived class only ) , private(access only in own class)

methodoverloading: same method name, functionality different eg.product(a,b), product(a,b,c)  overcome with dispatcher method

method overriding: same method name, functionality same + additionality

MRO- method resolution order  M(A), M(A,B), M
