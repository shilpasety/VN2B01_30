        <font color="brown" size="4" face="times new roman" >Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and 
        published by Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. It was originally
        created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, the 
        software has become the industry standard not only in 
        raster graphics editing, but in digital art as a whole.</font>
        <p><font color="burlywood" size="4" face="georgia">Multiple layers and supports masks, alpha compositing and 
            several color models including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot 
            color, and duotone. Photoshop uses its own PSD and PSB 
            file formats to support these features. In addition to 
            raster graphics, Photoshop has limited abilities to edit or
            render text</p></font>
