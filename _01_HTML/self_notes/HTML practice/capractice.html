        <h3>PHOTOSHOP</h3>
        <hr>
        Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and 
        published by Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. It was originally
        created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, the 
        software has become the industry standard not only in 
        raster graphics editing, but in digital art as a whole.

        <p align="right">The software's name has thus become a generic trademark,
         leading to its usage as a verb (e.g. "to photoshop an image",
          "photoshopping", and "photoshop contest") although 
          Adobe discourages such use.[5] Photoshop can edit and
           compose raster images.</p>

                compositing and several color models including RGB, 
                CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, and duotone. Photoshop uses
                 its own PSD and PSB file formats to support these 
                 features. In addition to raster graphics, Photoshop
                  has limited abilities to edit or render text</p>
